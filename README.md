# CameraClustering
Ascending Hierarchical Classification for Camera Clustering Based on FoV Overlaps

The objective of this application is to group cameras in the Wireless Multimedia Sensors Networks (WMSN) according to their field of view (FoV). Our system begins by searching for all the polygons created by the intersection of the fields of view of two cameras. Based on the generated surfaces, an ascending hierarchical classification is applied to group the cameras with strongly overlapping visions fields.

NB : the application is developed by JAVA language with Eclipse (Mars) and JDK 1.7.0_79

How the application works ?
- First, download the project, then import it into the eclipse.
- To launch the application, run the MainPrincipale class of InterfaceSimulation package
- You will see a window with buttons at the bottom
- Click on the firt button (Add Camera) to add a new camera in the middle of the window
- To change the location of a camera or delete it, click on the second button (Update Camera), select one of the functions that appear in the menu :
