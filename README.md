# Camera Clustering
## Ascending Hierarchical Classification for Camera Clustering Based on FoV Overlaps.

The objective of this application is to group cameras in the Wireless Multimedia Sensors Networks (WMSN) according to their field of view (FoV). Our system begins by searching for all the polygons created by the intersection of the fields of view of two cameras. Based on the generated surfaces, an ascending hierarchical classification is applied to group the cameras with strongly overlapping visions fields.

# Programming Language

The application is developed by **JAVA** language with **Eclipse** (*Mars*) and **JDK** 1.7.0_79
